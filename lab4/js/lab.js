//How to play Rock-Paper-Scissors:
//You and your partner start by placing your fist into your palm.
  //Then count to three and pound your fist into your palm on every count.
  //After three say, shoot aloud, and on shoot, pick either a scissors hand position, a fist for a rock, or a resting hand for paper. 
//Each partner will either have the same or a different position: scissors get broken by rock, paper covers rock, and scissors cut paper. 
//Play three rounds, and the best out of those rounds wins the game!
