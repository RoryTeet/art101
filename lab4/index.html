					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> we were asked to pseudo code making a grilled cheese and rock, paper, scissors.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h3>How to make a grilled cheese:</h3>
					<ol> 
						<li>Get out sliced bread, cheese, butter, a pan, a plate, and lastly a knife.</li>
						<li>Heat butter and spread it across the pan</li>
						<li>Place sliced bread with cheese on top of one another</li>
						<li>Flip the sandwich over until it gets to your desired level of crispiness</li> 
						<li>Place the sandwich on a plate and cut diagonally</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>How to play Rock Paper Scissors:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>You and your partner start by placing your fist into your palm.</li>
						<li>Then count to three and pound your fist into your palm on every count.</li>
						<li>After three say, shoot aloud, and on shoot, pick either a scissors hand position, a fist for a rock, or a resting hand for paper. </li>
						<li>Each partner will either have the same or a different position: scissors get broken by rock, paper covers rock, and scissors cut paper. </li>
						<li>Play three rounds, and the best out of those rounds wins the game!</li>
					</ol>
