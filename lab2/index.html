				<h1> Hello World</h1>
				<p> Charles is an Arts & Design: Games and Playable Media major at UC Santa Cruz. He focuses his efforts on systems design and creative direction, and is also a 2D digital illustrator on the side. He spends way too much of his time being a massive snob about his favorite forms of entertainment in film, TV, and especially games. Other than being an amateur media analyst, Charles is a big fan of Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, and Pathfinder 2nd Edition. Rory Teeter is a third-year sociology major at UCSC. They are originally from Los Angeles and hope to move to San Francisco after college. They like playing with their cat Juno, crocheting, and Sudoku in their free time, and are currently working as a childrenâ€™s aide in Santa Cruz.  </p>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of the lab is that we edited HTML and CSS files.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Based on the instructions, we were not sure if we needed to make a whole new index.html in the lab 2 folder because there was already one inside the folder.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>What supports our reflection is that any question we had any confusion on we either asked each other or the internet. Charles has prior coding experience and was familiar with a lot of what was on the lab; it was just in a new format for him. Since Rory had no prior coding experience, Charles was able to help Rory reflect on any errors and fix the mistakes that were made.
