				<h1> Hello World</h1>
				<p> Charles is an Arts & Design: Games and Playable Media major at UC Santa Cruz. He focuses his efforts on systems design and creative direction, and is also a 2D digital illustrator on the side. He spends way too much of his time being a massive snob about his favorite forms of entertainment in film, TV, and especially games. Other than being an amateur media analyst, Charles is a big fan of Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, and Pathfinder 2nd Edition. Rory Teeter is a third-year sociology major at UCSC. They are originally from Los Angeles and hope to move to San Francisco after college. They like playing with their cat Juno, crocheting, and Sudoku in their free time, and are currently working as a childrenâ€™s aide in Santa Cruz.  </p>
