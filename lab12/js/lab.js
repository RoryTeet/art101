Ice Wizards have the highest natural health points and defenses which enable them to take large amounts of damage without dying. It is very hard to defeat them. A lot of their functional spells have to do with increasing their defenses and absorbing damage. They also have the ability to taunt enemies, which forces the enemy to focus attacks on them. This can come in handy when playing in a group.";

Combined with this, they do low to moderate damage attack spells with extremely high accuracy rates. They also possess the sole group heal spell.";

Death Wizards belong to an advanced school, simply because most of their spells take multiple step combinations to use effectively. Their spells arenâ€™t the strongest, but some have the ability to absorb health from the enemy, which serves as a way for them to heal themselves. They have many preparatory spells that allow them to build up high-damage spells.";

They also have the ability of taking down defenses on other players, so if someone is stacking a bunch of defensive spells, a Myth wizard can get rid of them";
